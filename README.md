# CatchCopBot
 Methodologies and failures we faced:
 We used python with some libraries to achieve our target in this project.
 
 we tried making a chat bot using python but we couldnt implement it in the application
 we had a prototype model and we tried to implement it in our application but couldnt implement because of time constraint
 
 Libraries we used in our code:
 numpy,nltk(natural language tool kit),sklearn
 
 
 we have made a chatbot under the catchcop theme which will be interacting with the user and will help the user to know their rights on the road.
 A user may know the SOP and challan to be paid under the offence they've chosen or the offence under which the traffic cop have booked them under, this helps spread
 information and help the common man not get exploited or overfined due to lack of information.
