# CatchCopBot
 Methodologies and failures we faced:
 we tried making a chat bot using pyhton but we couldnt implement it in the application
 we had a prototype model and we tried to implement it in our application but couldnt do it properly because of time constraint
 
 Libraries we used in our code:
 numpy,nltk(natural language tool kit),sklearn
 
 
 we have made a challan bot which will be interacting with the user and will help the user to know his/her rights
 In case the traffic police catches them while breaking a traffic rule and gives them punishments which might be somethiing tht might not go through the traffic laws of our country
